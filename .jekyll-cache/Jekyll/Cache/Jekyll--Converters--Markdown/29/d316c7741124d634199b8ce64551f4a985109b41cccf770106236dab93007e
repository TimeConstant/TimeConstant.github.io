I",<p>One famous saying of Einstein, I don’t remember it exactly: We should start from simple questions, but not too simple ones.
Recently, when I’ve been learning the design flow of System-on-chip and hardware description languages, I noticed the concept of programming paradiagm.
I know from there that VHDL belongs to re-active languages.</p>

<p>Imperative:
	procedural: C
	object-oriented: C++</p>

<p>Declarative:
	functional:
	logic:
	Dataflow:
		reactive: VHDL</p>

<p>And I learned from Stanford open courses that one program written in C(Procedural) and C++ (object-oriented) separately, will however yield similar mmachine code in the end.
This brings up my interests in reviewing my C and C++ knowledge.</p>

<ol>
  <li>multi-dimentional array (data type can be any numericals, such as int, float, double)   —&gt; application in signal processing, numerical analysis</li>
  <li>string + Regular Expression.   								—&gt; application in web server or any file based system</li>
  <li>compound data type 											—&gt; database, entry</li>
</ol>
