I"G<p>Numpy is the first python module I worked with when I start to learn this language. I used conda to configure the development env at that time, then I switch to Pycharm later on.
Few more packages I had experiences with including matplotlib, pyQt, keras, scikit-learn, (sth. used for XML parsing), Flask, cv2, env, etc.</p>
