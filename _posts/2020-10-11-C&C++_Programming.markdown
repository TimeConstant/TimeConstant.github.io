One famous saying of Einstein, I don't remember it exactly: We should start from simple questions, but not too simple ones.
Recently, when I've been learning the design flow of System-on-chip and hardware description languages, I noticed the concept of programming paradiagm.
I know from there that VHDL belongs to re-active languages. 

Imperative:
	procedural: C
	object-oriented: C++

Declarative:
	functional:
	logic:
	Dataflow:
		reactive: VHDL
		
And I learned from Stanford open courses that one program written in C(Procedural) and C++ (object-oriented) separately, will however yield similar mmachine code in the end.
This brings up my interests in reviewing my C and C++ knowledge.
	
1. multi-dimentional array (data type can be any numericals, such as int, float, double)   ---> application in signal processing, numerical analysis
2. string + Regular Expression.   								---> application in web server or any file based system
3. compound data type 											---> database, entry
