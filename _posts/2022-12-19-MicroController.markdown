I've been looking into microcontrollers in a weekend. I summerize my findings here.

uMC shares similarity with cpu and SoC as it's a small system made of many other functional units 
and the main part cpu can be divided into CISC and RISC, but are different to them in the sense of scale, process,...
Users have a bounch of choices, like 51, AVR, STM32, ...
But even for each of the names, portofolios stand behind, depending on the address-width(4,8,16,32), the IO properties...
