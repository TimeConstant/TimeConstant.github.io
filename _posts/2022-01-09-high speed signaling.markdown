1. communication stack: physical (), transmission ()
   electrical spec., protocal
2. Component dependent (between master device and slave device)
3. Application depedent 
(PCIe, SSD... in server area, USB in mobile device, RS484 in industry, CAN in car inductry, 
depends on the dominent requirements: speed, standardlarity, reliabiliy)
