The key standpoint of its internal foundry department. 
Problems arise from the delay in 14nm node, where processing engineers keep persuing high density,
but CPU design team couldn't really make use of such high density as benefit for their designs.

The decision made to send some chip manufacture to a Taiwanese counterpart, causes negative influence on the DESIGN FLOW.
As the design flow are nowdays highly dependent on the process and EDA tool, which works coopratively.
Cherry's customized design flow couldn't catch up with the automation trend as the critical datapathes are usually handmade. 

IP re-use with clearly save the cost.
